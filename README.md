## Resume
### Projects
#### Personal projects
Demonstrate your coding skills, these can be put on your resume and will be discussed in your interviews.
Ideas:

* [Reddit - Examples of Good Projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5vycbw/examples_of_good_projects/)
* [Antrikshy - How I got started with programming side projects](http://antrikshy.com/blog/how-i-got-started-with-programming-side-projects)
* [Reddit - /r/learnprogramming project ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_practice_exercises_and_project_ideas.3F)
#### Open source contributions
Another way to demonstrate coding skills that recruiters love. Here are some links and guides:
* [FreeCodeCamp - How to contribute to open source](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)
* [Github search for easy issues](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy)

## Applying
Make a spreasheet of companies that you'd like to apply to. Have columns such as company name, website, application status, and similar. To find companies to apply to have a look at these  websites:
* [Github - easy application](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application)
* [Intern.supply](http://www.intern.supply/)
* Your imagination! If there's a company you like, have a look on their website or send them an email (typically careers@company.com).

Some companies will have a form online, but some you'll have to cold email. Apply to as many as you'd like, preferably 30+.
